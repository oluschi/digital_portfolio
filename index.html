      <p>	My name is Oluschi Harmon and I am currently enrolled at Parsons School of Design in NYC. As of right now, I am a rising junior studying as a Communication Design major and a minoring in Fashion Communication. As a graphic designer, my philosophy when it comes to my work is based on a quote by Elsie de Wolfe <span class="italic">“I am going to make everything around me beautiful, that will be my life”.</span> I hope my design portfolio can provide you with some insight into my skills and I hope that you enjoy it. </p>
